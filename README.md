## Credits
I give credit to the internet to help me create the quiz and the slide show of questions. I then modified the variables and functions to perform to the acceptance criteria.

## My Task
At some point in my journey to become a full-stack web developer, I will likely be asked to complete a coding assessment&mdash;perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help familiarize myself with these tests and allow me to use the skills covered in this unit, this week’s homework invites me to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

This week’s coursework will equip you with all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

If you are the grader of this assignment and get this far in the README... Congratulations! In our grading comments please provide me with the answer to the universe provided in "The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy".
